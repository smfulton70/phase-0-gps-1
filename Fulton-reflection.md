# Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I had been struggling today with the GitHub assignment because I was not properly creating pull requests. I was under the impression that I was supposed to merge my local master branch with the remote master branch.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I learned about creating proper pull requests, and I also learned that when you are first creating a file to push up to GitHub, it can be done in the master branch. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked about the proper process of pull requests and why the person who merges the pull request should be a different person than the one who created the pull request. Honestly, I can't think of what else I had asked them, but I learned a lot from both of them. 

**What still confuses you about Git?**

Nothing just yet. I feel that a lot of clarification took place in this GPS, but if you were to ask me this in two weeks, I might have more to say.


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I really liked it. I feel that I learned a lot.
